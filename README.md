# Pattern-Recognition-in-Microbiomes

This repository aims to develop a web application to process and build a machine-learning model to geographically classify organisms at a taxonomical level. 

# Pre-requisites
Before running this app, make sure to install the required modules. Navigate to the requirements.txt file and run the code below in your suitable terminal environment

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or 
```

```
# Decription
The coded app contains four sections. Some sections are yet to be completed and hence warned about.
- Upload
- Profiling (incomplete)
- Modeling
- Download

## Upload 
This section is designed to process and model our dataset. Please ensure that you upload the OTUs, taxonomic, and metadata tables. Ensure that all columns in the sampled tables are named correctly. Use a single space (' ') as the separator for the OTUs and tax files, and use a tab space ('\t') for the metadata.
